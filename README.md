# SQL-assignments
This project was made as an assignment for Practicum100 Data Analyst course as a part of a Final Project for the course.

In this project we use Python as well as PostgreSQL relational databases.

Project description:
The coronavirus took the entire world by surprise, changing everyone's daily routine. City dwellers no longer spent their free time outside, going to cafes and malls; more people were at home, reading books. That attracted the attention of startups that rushed to develop new apps for book lovers.

We've been given a database of one of the services competing in this market. It contains data on books, publishers, authors, and customer ratings and reviews of books. This information will be used to generate a value proposition for a new product.

Project structure:

1. General information. Studying the given tables.
2. Data queries. Making calculations for the proposition.
3. Conclusion.

Additional information:

* The project was created in Jupyter Notebook, so to run it you should have Anaconda installed. It has a Table of Contents for easier navigation.

This project was created by Mila Lunacharska, in April 2022.
